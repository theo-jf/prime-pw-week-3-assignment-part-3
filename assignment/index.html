    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>I've been using 'const' rather than 'let' when defining the array variables to be cycled through in my For Of loops 
        (simply because this is what I've noticed being done on a majority of internet examples). Is this a standard practice that I should continue, or does it not matter? </li>
      <li>Are there certain coding situations where it would be beneficial to use For Of loops rather than basic For loops?</li>
    </ol>
